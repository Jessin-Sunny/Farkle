# 🎲 Farkle - A Dice Game
Farkle is a fast-paced dice game where players roll six dice to score points through combinations, risking losing their turn’s score if they roll without scoring.
## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 Two-player mode
- 🎲 Dice roll animation

## 📌 Game Rules
Each turn, a player rolls 6 dice.
Dice that form scoring combinations can be kept, and the player can either roll the remaining dice or bank the score.
If none of the dice score in a roll, it's a Farkle, and the turn ends with no points.
If all 6 dice score in one turn, the player can roll all dice again.
First player to reach 10,000 points wins!
